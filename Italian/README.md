# Italian Recipes

Everyone and their grandmother will have an opinion on what the right recipe is for any given Italian dish. Sometimes they're regional, sometimes they just vary from one family to another, and sometimes they're very, very wrong. 

Here I try to stay as authentic as possible based on my experiences in Italy, which mostly revolve around Florence and Tuscany. Sometimes, recipes will be tweaked because they make sense or because of ingredient quality and availability.

In the end, make them the way you enjoy them.

## Tennants of Italian cooking

* **Use fresh ingredients.** The main exception here is that high quality tinned San Marzano tomatoes are often better than the horrible local watery varieties we get.
* **Use feeling.** Ingredient proportions are often guidelines. Taste and feel.
* **Don't cook with any wine you wouldn't drink.** Even if you buy cheap wine to cook with, make it good cheap wine.
* **Buy good quality olive oil.** The big brand stuff from the grocery store is not going to taste great.
* **Take your time.** Don't try to rush these recipes. If it says simmer for 3 hours, that means 3 hours.
