# Spaghetti alla Carbonara

Simplicity is at the core of this dish. 

If you buy quality ingredients for absolutely everything, you can't mess this up.

## Notes

- Spaghetti: Head to the Italian grocer and buy top quality spaghetti. No cheap stuff from the grocery store.
- Pecorino: While you're there, grab a fresh wedge Pecorino Romano. Don't buy pre-shredded, and absolutely don't buy shelf-stable tinned stuff. If you really can't find Pecorino, some people use Parmigiano Reggiano or a mix of both. This is a recipe (hah) for getting yelled at by any Italian you might meet, but I have some otherwise pretty good Italian cookbooks that recommend a mix here, so take that for what you will.
- Guanciale: This is cured pork cheek, and it's delicious if you can find a good one. If it's not available, mild pancetta is a less fatty alternative, although not authentic.
- Eggs: Use farm fresh organic eggs, if possible.

## Common mistakes

- Not using real Pecorino Romano. It's absolutely essential in this dish.
- Substituting bacon instead of guanciale/pancetta. It's very different and not a good substitution.
- Using fresh spaghetti. Making fresh pasta is awesome, but you want the firmness of a good quality dried pasta here.
- Cooking your guanciale too hot. You need low temp to render the fat, then turn it up a bit to crisp it up.
   
## Ingredients
_serves 2 people_

- 250g spaghetti
- 125g pecorino romano
- 125g guanciale
- 4 egg yolks
- salt & pepper, to taste

## Mise en place

1. Start boiling your pasta water. Don't forget the salt!
2. Dice the guanciale into even 5-8mm cubes.
3. Shred your pecorino and split it into two halves.
4. Separate your egg whites and yolks.

## Preparation

1. Mix yolks with one half of the cheese, and add a generous amount of fresh cracked black pepper. 
2. Heat a pan to medium-low heat. Add your guanciale. Let the fat start to render.
3. When the fat becomes translucent, raise the heat to medium-high to allow it to crisp up.
4. Remove guanciale from the pan and toss it along with the rendered fat into your egg and cheese mixture.
5. Boil your pasta until _al dente_. A few minutes before your pasta is ready, scoop out about a cup of pasta water and let it cool to lukewarm.
6. Add pasta water a little bit at a time to your sauce mixture until the desired thickness is reached.
7. Add pasta to sauce mixture and stir well to coat.
8. Plate and serve immediately. Top with the remaining shredded cheese and a generous amount of black pepper.
