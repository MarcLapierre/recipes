# Mapo Tofu

At first glance, this looks like a really intimidating dish. If you order this at a restaurant, you might think you can never make it at home.

The reality is that it's incredibly easy to make, and very quick to throw together if you need fast dinner. 

## Equipment

- A Chinese style wok is best for cooking this dish, but you can also use a saut√© pan if you don't have a wok.
- Mortar and pestle for grinding the spices. You can also use the bottom of a pot or a rolling pin. Get creative.
- Rice cooker

## Notes

- This recipe requires a lot of unfamiliar ingredients, so a trip to a good Chinese market is a requirement. There are no substitutions for most of these ingredients.
- Traditionally, ground beef is used in this recipe. Pork is also common. Use what you like.

## Common mistakes

- Using too much meat. The ratios are important.
- Using the wrong tofu. Make sure your package says _soft_ tofu.
- Using low heat. This needs to cook on the hottest temperature you can manage. I keep my 25,000 BTU burner maxed out for this one.
   
## Ingredients
_serves 3-4 people_

- 2 cups short-grain white rice
- 300g soft tofu
- 100g ground pork

- 3/4 cup chinese chicken stock (or bouillon)
- 1-2 spring onions
- 1 tbsp corn starch

## Mise en place

1. Make your rice - rice cooker not optional. (don't forget to wash your rice!)
2. Heat your wok to medium heat and lightly toast the sichuan peppercorns until fragrant. Don't burn them!
3. In a mortal and pestle, smash your sichuan peppercorns until well ground.
4. In a small bowl, mix your doubanjiang, douchi, tianmiangjiang, lajiao fen, chili oil, and sichuan peppercorns.
5. In another bowl, mix your chicken stock, cooking wine, and soy sauce.
6. Slice your spring onions, separating the whites and greens.
7. Boil some salted water and dice your tofu into 1" cubes.
8. Mix your cornstarch with 1 tbsp cold water in a bowl.

## Preparation

1. Add your tofu to the boiling water.
1. Get your wok screaming hot.
2. Add a bit of oil and your ground pork. Keep it moving so it doesn't burn until cooked through.
3. Add your spicy condiments bowl and cook for a few minutes until well fragrant.
4. Add your wet mix and white parts of the spring onions, and get back to a boil.
5. Scoop your tofu out of the water and into the wok, and toss it around softly so it doesn't break (push softly with your wok ladle).
6. Add the green parts of the spring onions and the corn starch mix.
7. Mix well and let boil for a minute or so, then serve immediately. Add an extra spoonful of chili oil to dress if desired.
