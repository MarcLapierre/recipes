# Nam Prik Pao (น้ำพริกเผา)

One of they key Thai red chili pastes, Nam Prik Pao is not used to make curry. It's the base behind the populat Tom Yum soups, and a delicious dip for vegetables. This recipe comes straight from a Bangkok family that has been selling Nam Prik (Thai curry paste) at a local market for generations, so you can bet on it's authenticity.

## Equipment

- A Thai style wok with a flat bottom is best for cooking this dish, but you can also use a sauté pan if you don't have a wok.
- Mortar and pestle for crushing the aromatics

## Notes

- You can't substitute the mortar and pestle for this recipe as getting a smooth paste is key. This can't be achieved with a food processor.
- Don't overcook the paste or it'll become rock hard.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup shallots, sliced thin
- 1/4 cup garlic, sliced thin
- 12 large dried Thai red chilis
- 3 tbsp tamarind concentrate
- 2 tbsp palm sugar
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp Thai shrimp paste
- Vegetable oil for frying

## Preparation

1. Add 1 cup of vegetable oil to your wok and fry the garlic until slightly browned. Remove and set aside. Repeat with shallots, then chilis. 
2. Add the vegetables to the mortar and pestle and pound to a smooth paste.
3. Pour out most of the oil, keeping only 1/4 cup. Add the shimp paste and fry until fragrant. 
4. Add the chili paste, tamarind concentrate, palm sugar, and salt. Fry for a few minutes until you see the oil start to separate. Keep stirring to prevent sticking. Taste and adjust the seasoning as you like.
