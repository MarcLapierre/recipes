# Green Curry (แกงเขียวหวาน)

_Gaeng Khiao Waan_, the classic Thai Green Curry. One of the benchmark dishes by which I judge Thai restaurants, and let me tell you, most of them get it wrong. But you'll get it right, with this recipe, passed down to me from a Bangkok family that has been selling Nam Prik (Thai curry paste) at a local market for generations. 

## Equipment

- A Thai style wok with a flat bottom is best for cooking this dish, but you can also use a sauté pan if you don't have a wok.
- Mortar and pestle for making the curry paste
- Rice cooker

## Notes

- When buying coconut milk, look at the fat percentage. You should target the 40%-50% range for Thai curries as we'll be adding in the water separately. Any lower than that ("light" coconut milks) will result in a thin curry. I recommend the larger resealable bottles or boxes over the cans as they tend to be a bit higher quality, but make sure you get a Thai brand if possible.
- Choice of protein matters. White meat chicken is too dry, thigh and legs are best, deboned and skin removed. Striploin steak is also a good choice, make sure you cut it against the grain. Don't choose any cuts that need long simmer times.
- Fish sauce: Brand matters here. Squid brand (_contains no squid_) is the go to that you can find in just about any Asian market. Megachef is a slightly more premium brand currently enjoying a surge in popularity in Thailand, but it can be hard to find unless you have a Thai specific grocery store in your town.
- Palm sugar: You can buy these in dried pucks or in liquid tubs. You can use either, but I find the liquid one easier to work with. If you use the dried ones, shave it as small as possible so that it melts more easily.
- Fresh green peppercorn: These can be hard to find fresh, but you can often find them in brine in South-East Asian markets.

## Common mistakes

- Vegetable selection is key to an authentic curry. Avoid using carrots, bell peppers, brocoli, mushrooms, baby corn, snow peas, or other North American vegetables (and run away from restaurants serving these).
- The type of eggplant matters. Thai eggplants are green and the size of golf balls. Don't use Chinese or Italian eggplan, they'll disintegrate into the curry because they are too soft.
- Thai basil can't be replaced with other basil types. Don't use Italian basil or other types of herbs as a substitute.
 
## Ingredients
_serves 3-4 people_

- Jasmine rice
- 1 batch of fresh [Thai green chili paste](https://github.com/MarcLapierre/recipes/blob/main/Thai/green-curry-paste.md)
- 1 cup of high quality coconut milk
- 1 cup of water
- 300g Chicken thigh or Striploin steak
- 8-10 Thai eggplants
- 1/2 cup pea eggplant (optional)
- 1 branch fresh green peppercorn (optional)
- 3 tbsp Fish sauce
- 2 tbsp Palm sugar
- 1 bunch fresh Thai basil

## Mise en place

1. Slice the Thai eggplant into quarters and soak in water to soften them slightly. Pick the pea eggplants from the stem and add them to the water.
2. Cut your protein into bite-sized chunks and set aside. If using steak, make sure to cut against the grain. Pieces should be no bigger than 1 square inch. 
3. Pick the fresh green peppercorns from the branch and throw them in the mortar. Bruise them slightly, just enough to crush each peppercorn open. Of you don't have a mortar, you can crush them with a pan, rolling pin, or the flat edge of a cleaver.
4. Pluck the basil leaves from the stem. Don't tear or cut them. 
5. Prepare your rice

## Preparation

1. Put the coconut milk in a cold wok and turn on the heat to medium. Heat until it starts to bubble.
2. Add in the curry paste and mix well. Bring back up to a boil until the oil from the coconut milk starts to separate slightly. If using canned coconut milk, it may not separate due to the addition of stabilizers.
3. Add in your protein and mix well. Keep stirring until your protein is about 80% cooked. 
4. Add the water and bring back to a boil. 
5. Drain the eggplants and add to the wok. Add the peppercorns, fish sauce, and palm sugar. Simmer gently until the eggplants are tender.
7. Adjust fish sauce and palm sugar to taste.
8. Stir in the fresh basil leaves and cook for another 30 seconds.
9. Serve immediately with jasmine rice.
