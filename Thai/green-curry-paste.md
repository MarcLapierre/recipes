# Green Curry Paste (พริกแกงเขียวหวาน)

Also known as _Prik Gaeng Khiao Waan_, this Thai green curry paste is the base for the ubiquitous Thai Green Curry. 

You may be tempted to buy the curry paste tin and save yourself some work, but a freshly pounded curry paste will make a drastic difference in the quality of your green curry. I urge you to try it at least once.

Whatever you do, don't compromise on the ingredients or try to take a shortcut here. All ingredients should be fresh and whole, not dried, frozen, or pre-prepared. Use the Thai or Asian variations of ingredients when possible.

## Equipment

A large granite mortar and pestle is necessary to make the curry paste, preferably a Thai version with a very large pestle and a bowl that is at least 7" across. If you're using a smaller one, you may need to pound the paste in batches. 

Do not use a clay, wood, ceramic, or marble mortar or pestle, it won't be strong enough to make a paste and may crack from the pounding.

## Notes

- Ginger is not a substitute for galangal. They may look similar, but they taste very different, and ginger will ruin your curry paste. 
- Some recipes will call for Makrut lime leaf -- although a common mistake, that is incorrect. Only the zest should be used. 
- Use the smaller Asian shallots and garlic if possible. They have a slightly different flavour profile than the western versions.
- There are two types of Thai green chilis: the longer Sky Pointing Chili (Prik Chee Fah - less spicy) and the shorter Bird's Eye Chili (Prik Kee Noo - more spicy). You can use either, both, or a mix of the two. Discard the stems, but keep the seeds and membranes: they are necessary to achieve the right flavour. For a mild curry, use ~20 Sky Pointing Chili. For a spicier curry, use a mix of both types and/or more chilis.
- Coriander root does not mean coriander stem. Find a coriander bunch with the roots attached. It may take a few tries before you find them. Thai grocery stores are your best bet, or you can grow your own!
- You can throw your ingredients in the mortar without mincing them, but you'll just be making your life harder with a lot more pounding. 
- A food processor is not a substitute for a mortar and pestle. The pounding motion breaks the cells in a way that a food processor can't replicate, resulting in a smoother paste and more flavour.
- Feel free to adjust the ratios of ingredients to your taste.
 
## Ingredients

- 1/2 tsp Cumin seeds, whole
- 1/2 tsp Coriander seeds, whole
- 1/2 tsp White peppercorn, whole
- 2-3 Lemongrass stalks, sliced
- 1 tbsp Galangal, minced
- 3 large Coriander Roots, minced
- 1 whole Makrut Lime, zested
- 20-30 Thai Green Chilis, minced
- 3 tbsp Thai Shallots, minced
- 3 tbsp Garlic, minced
- 2 tsp Thai Shrimp Paste
- 1/4 tsp Salt

## Preparation

1. Add the cumin seeds, coriander seeds, and white peppercorns to a cold wok or pan and turn the heat on to medium. Keep the spices moving in the pan so they don't burn. Once the spices become fragrant, turn off the heat and transfer the spices to the mortar.
2. Pound the spices until they turn to powder. Remove from the mortar and set aside. 
3. Remove the stem and the rough outer leaves of the lemongrass. Slice thinly from the stem until the purple rings disappear. Add to the mortar along with the minced galangal, and pound into a smooth paste.
4. Slice your green chilis, coriander roots, and zest your entire makrut lime. Add everything to the paste in the mortar and pound until smooth.
5. Mince your shallots and garlic. Add them to the paste in the mortar along with your salt and the previously pounded spice mix. Pound everything to a smooth paste.
6. Add the Thai shrimp paste and pound until smooth.
