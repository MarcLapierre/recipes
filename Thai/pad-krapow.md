# Pad Krapow (ผัดกะเพรา)

Holy Basil stir fry is a staple street food across Thailand. The fragrant sweet and spicy dish can pack a punch, and it makes an excellent breakfast topped with a fried egg.

## Equipment

- A Thai style wok with a flat bottom is best for cooking this dish, but you can also use a sauté pan if you don't have a wok.
- Mortar and pestle for crushing the aromatics
- Rice cooker

## Notes

- Mincing your own meat will make this dish infinitely better. The best way is to use a good cleaver and mince it by hand, but grinding your own using a coarse meat grinder is also acceptable. Pork shoulder is ideal, but dark meat chicken is a common substitute.

## Common mistakes

- Holy Basil is not the same as Thai sweet basil. Don't let the name fool you, it's a different herb with it's own flavour profile, and is not a substitute. While you can make this dish with Thai sweet basil, it would no longer be Pad Krapow but Pad Horapha. Whatever you do, don't substitute for Italian basil.
- Crushing the aromatics in a mortar intensifies the flavour significantly. Some recipes will tell you to simply dice them up, but that's not sufficient. If you don't have. mortar and pestle, smash them under the broad side of a cleaver after a coarse chop to simulate the pounding effect.
- Leave the seeds and membranes in your chilies. That's where all the flavour is. If you find the dish too spicy, simply use fewer chilies.
