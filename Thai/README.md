# Thai Recipes

Thai food is one of the most misunderstood cuisines in the west. Our references are often the one local Thai restaurant that is often using tinned curry pastes, toned down flavours, and more often than not, very different ingredients from what you'll find in Thailand, all in an effort to appeal to the unadventurous local population.

The recipes I've gathered here are direct from Thailand, many of them from chefs who own local restaurants as well as long time vendors from local markets in Bangkok and Chiang Mai. Nothing has been toned down for western palates, and some of the ingredients are going to be hard to find despite my insistance that substitutions are not recommended. 

It'll be well worth it. Enjoy the adventure.

## How to spot great Thai restaurants

* **They serve exclusively Thai food.** If you see a mix of dishes from other cultures, it probably won't be great.
* **Mortars and pestles are plentiful.** It's nearly impossible to make Thai food without a mortar and pestle. Look and listen for them. Food processors shouldn't be used.
* **Correct vegetables in the curries.** Look at the Google photos. If you see brocoli, bell peppers, carrots, mushrooms, snap peas, and/or other western vegetables in the curries or other dishes, run. What you should see is Thai eggplant, squash, bamboo, and other Thai veggies. Surprisingly, pineapple can be ok here.
* **The green curry is actually green.** If it looks white, it's going to taste like coconut. It should be a deep green with the oil just starting to separate on the surface.
* **They use Holy Basil in their Pad Grapow.** So many restaurants use Thai sweet basil here. It can be done, but it's not the same dish. Although if you see any Italian basil, that's very wrong.

## Closing comments

There are lots of recipes for the same dishes, and many of them are valid. Most often, the variances are in the proportions of the ingredients, which you should experiement with and adjust to your taste. The big red flags you need to look out for are missing and/or incorrect ingredients, which usually indicate a westernization of the dish.
