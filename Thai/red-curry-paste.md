# Red Curry Paste (พริกแกงเผ็ด)

Also known as _Prik Gaeng Ped_, this Thai red curry paste is the base for the ubiquitous Thai Red Curry. 

You may be tempted to buy the curry paste tin and save yourself some work, but a freshly pounded curry paste will make a drastic difference in the quality of your red curry. I urge you to try it at least once.

Whatever you do, don't compromise on the ingredients or try to take a shortcut here. All ingredients should be fresh and whole, not dried (unless specified), frozen, or pre-prepared. Use the Thai or Asian variations of ingredients when possible.

## Equipment

A large granite mortar and pestle is necessary to make the curry paste, preferably a Thai version with a very large pestle and a bowl that is at least 7" across. If you're using a smaller one, you may need to pound the paste in batches. 

Do not use a clay, wood, ceramic, or marble mortar or pestle, it won't be strong enough to make a paste and may crack from the pounding.

## Notes

- Ginger is not a substitute for galangal. They may look similar, but they taste very different, and ginger will ruin your curry paste. 
- Some recipes will call for Makrut lime leaf -- although a common mistake, that is incorrect. Only the zest should be used. 
- Use the smaller Asian shallots and garlic if possible. They have a slightly different flavour profile than the western versions.
- There are two types of dried Thai red chilis: the smaller and larger chilis. The smaller ones are spicier, the larger ones are quite mild. I recommend using about 10 of each, the larger ones for color and flavour, and the smaller ones for heat. Feel free to re-adjust the proportions, but ensure you keep the seeds and membranes as they provide a key part of the flavour. 
- Coriander root does not mean coriander stem. Find a coriander bunch with the roots attached. It may take a few tries before you find them. Thai grocery stores are your best bet, or you can grow your own!
- You can throw your ingredients in the mortar without mincing them, but you'll just be making your life harder with a lot more pounding. 
- A food processor is not a substitute for a mortar and pestle. The pounding motion breaks the cells in a way that a food processor can't replicate, resulting in a smoother paste and more flavour.
- Feel free to adjust the ratios of ingredients to your taste.
 
## Ingredients

- 1/2 tsp Cumin seeds, whole
- 1/2 tsp Coriander seeds, whole
- 1/2 tsp White peppercorn, whole
- 2-3 Lemongrass stalks, sliced
- 1 tbsp Galangal, minced
- 3 large Coriander Roots, minced
- 1 whole Makrut Lime, zested
- 20 dried Thai Red Chilis, rehydrated
- 3 tbsp Thai Shallots, minced
- 3 tbsp Garlic, minced
- 2 tsp Thai Shrimp Paste
- 1/4 tsp Salt

## Preparation

1. Soak the chilies in warm water for about 10 minutes to rehydrate them. When they're soft and pliable, drain the water.
2. Add the cumin seeds, coriander seeds, and white peppercorns to a cold wok or pan and turn the heat on to medium. Keep the spices moving in the pan so they don't burn. Once the spices become fragrant, turn off the heat and transfer the spices to the mortar.
3. Pound the spices until they turn to powder. Remove from the mortar and set aside. 
4. Remove the stem and the rough outer leaves of the lemongrass. Slice thinly from the stem until the purple rings disappear. Add to the mortar along with the minced galangal, and pound into a smooth paste.
5. Slice your red chilis, coriander roots, and zest your entire makrut lime. Add everything to the paste in the mortar and pound until smooth.
6. Mince your shallots and garlic. Add them to the paste in the mortar along with your salt and the previously pounded spice mix. Pound everything to a smooth paste.
7. Add the Thai shrimp paste and pound until smooth.
